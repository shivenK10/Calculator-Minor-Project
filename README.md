Project Report: Calculator Application
Project Title: Calculator Application with Dark Mode
 
1. Introduction

This project aims to create a user-friendly calculator application with basic arithmetic operations and additional functionalities such as percentage, square, and square root calculations. The application also includes a dark mode feature for better user experience in low-light environments.

2. Objectives

•	Develop a functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations.

•	Implement additional features like percentage, square, and square root calculations.

•	Incorporate a dark mode for improved usability in different lighting conditions.

•	Ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.

3. Technologies Used

•	HTML5 for the structure of the web application.

•	CSS3 for styling and layout.

•	JavaScript for functionality and interactivity.

4. Implementation

4.1. HTML Structure

The HTML file (index.html) defines the basic structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers, operators, and additional functions. It links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for functionality.

4.2. CSS Styling

The CSS file (style.css) provides styling for the calculator, including the layout, colors, and dark mode styles.

4.3. JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the logic for the calculator's operations, including appending numbers and operators, calculating results, clearing the display, and toggling dark mode.

5. Testing

The application was tested on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and functionality. Both light and dark modes were verified to work correctly, and all calculator operations were tested for accuracy.

6. Conclusion

The project successfully created a calculator application with a clean user interface and additional functionalities. The dark mode feature enhances usability in different lighting conditions, providing a better user experience.

7. Future Enhancements

•	Implement advanced mathematical functions like trigonometric calculations.

•	Add a history feature to keep track of previous calculations.

•	Improve the user interface with animations and transitions.
